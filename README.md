# 50-Projects

Hello! i'm just learning javascript and coding for the first time, and on my own. 
While using freeCodeCamp and the Odin Project, I wanted to see the reality of what i'm learning.
I'm therefore building projects (from tutorials, ofcourse) to fine-tune my HTML, CSS and Javascript skills.
I hope that by the end of these projects, I'm able to gain a deeper understanding of this whole programming thing.
Thank you.
